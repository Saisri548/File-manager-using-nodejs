Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code outside the browser, mainly on the server side.Node.js is asynchronous and event-driven, which means it can handle multiple requests at the same time without blocking the execution. This makes Node.js very fast and efficient for building scalable applications.
